# Publishing

Start with `dry-run: true` and no publication secrets. Both application publishers
rerun CI for the same `github.sha`, verify its immutable artifact and default to
simulation. All jobs run on `ubuntu-24.04` with explicit timeouts. Every
Orchestration-Maestro repository is public, which is what makes the environment
reviewers and artifact attestations below available on the GitHub Team plan.

Dependency reads use crates.io directly and tool assets use official GitHub URLs.
Binary assets and release evidence go only to an existing GitHub Release. Crates
go explicitly to public crates.io, never to an arbitrary registry. Evidence live
publication is now limited to protected release tags; this no longer archives
all runs. Ordinary CI reports still expire after seven days.

## Shared application publisher contract

| Input | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `working-directory` | string | `.` | Validated Cargo package/workspace path |
| `dry-run` | boolean | `true` | Validate/stage only, no authorization API or live publication |
| `artifact-key` | string | `publish-binaries` / `publish-crate` | Unique CI invocation key for this directory/run |
| `coverage-threshold`, `license-policy`, `mutation-test`, `sarif-reports`, `clippy-level`, `dependency-audit`, `unsafe-policy`, `unused-dependencies`, `api-compatibility` | as in [ci.md](ci.md) | as in `ci.yml` | Forwarded unchanged to the CI run, so a release passes the same gates as the project's own CI. `rust-version` is not: a release builds with the committed pin |

Both return string outputs `artifact-id`, `artifact-name` and `revision` from CI.
They identify the validated release artifact, not proof of publication; a later
staging or publication failure does not invalidate their existence. No publication
URL is returned.

## Live approval boundary

Every live publisher requires all of the following:

1. Explicit `dry-run: false`, a `push` or `workflow_dispatch` event and a
   ruleset-protected `refs/tags/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (optional prerelease suffix).
2. The pre-existing `release` environment with nonempty required reviewers and
   exactly one custom deployment policy: type `tag`, name `v*`.
3. Successful API verification of those protections in preflight and again just
   before writing. Missing configuration, unavailable protection, API errors,
   permission errors or unexpected JSON fail closed. GitHub must approve the
   publishing job through that environment.
4. A caller permission ceiling matching the workflow: `actions: read` for the
   environment API, plus `contents: write` for binary/evidence uploads or
   `contents: read` for crate publication. Only conditional live upload jobs
   request a write scope; dry-run jobs execute with read-only permissions.

Required reviewers are available because every repository in the organization
is public; on GitHub Team a private repository could not meet this boundary.
The environment name alone never proves approval. See
[platform requirements](platform-requirements.md#live-protection-availability)
for official API permissions and plan restrictions. No PAT or new approval
variable is used, and no job configures its own protection.

## Binary publisher

`publish-binaries.yml` downloads the exact CI artifact ID and verifies checksums,
source revision, target and nonempty binary selection. Dry-run stops after that
verification. It never unpacks/executes release payloads or runs a live publisher.

The protected job downloads the same immutable artifact and verifies it again.
The Release must already exist for the selected tag, and the remote tag must
resolve to the validated commit. All three local files must exist as nonempty
regular files, and no matching remote asset may exist before upload:
`payload.tar.gz`, `provenance.json`, `SHA256SUMS`.

`gh release upload` adds those files without `--clobber`. The workflow never
creates a release/tag or replaces an asset. Uploads are not a transaction: a
network failure may leave earlier assets uploaded. Inspect the failed release
before an explicitly authorized repair; a rerun refuses existing assets rather
than silently overwriting them. A successful upload is not an attestation.

## Crate publisher

Additional inputs for `publish-crate.yml`:

| Input | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `package` | string | required | Exact member name, 1 to 64 safe Cargo-name characters, never a package-ID expression |
| `semver-check` | boolean | `false` | Compare against the newest published version; leave off for a first release without a baseline |

The only publication secret is the existing optional `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`:
a scoped public crates.io token, required and read only in the protected live
step. Prefer the protected environment's secret. Map it explicitly if supplied
from the caller; never use `secrets: inherit`.

Dry-run needs only path and package. It runs CI, verifies its artifact, selects
exactly one workspace member with Cargo metadata, and runs
`cargo package --package NAME --locked`, including packaging verification.
It never calls `cargo publish`. Independently packaging a crate with unpublished
sibling dependencies can fail; multi-crate release ordering is not implemented.

Live release additionally requires the tag to equal `v` plus the package version
and the manifest's `publish` list, if set, to permit `crates-io`. `publish = false`
forbids release. The protected job checks out the validated SHA, creates private
Cargo state, installs the validated compiler, rechecks event/ref/revision and
actual environment protection, and invokes
`cargo publish --locked --no-verify --package NAME --registry crates-io`.
The crates.io sparse index, token and `cargo:token` provider are explicit process
environment values. There is no private registry selector or fallback.

Cargo may repackage; it does not upload our staged `.crate` verbatim. Verification
already succeeded without the token. Review source/build scripts and Cargo
configuration before approving publication. Everything uploaded to the public
registry is public.

## Release evidence

`publish-evidence.yml` is separate so ordinary CI callers need no write scope.

| Input | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact-name` | string | required | CI artifact name, without its `-reports` suffix; downloaded from this run |
| `revision` | string | required | Immutable source SHA, equal to `github.sha` and the scorecard revision |
| `dry-run` | boolean | `true` | Validate reports and create a local archive only |

No secret is accepted. The staging job requires a nonempty scorecard, matching
source revision and only regular files/directories inside `evidence`, without
symlinks or escapes. It produces `evidence.tar.gz` locally. Dry-run ends there.

Live upload requires the same protected tag, verified `release` environment and
pre-existing Release as the binary publisher. The protected job downloads the
same run's reports and validates them again before uploading `evidence.tar.gz`
without replacement. Reports may describe failed controls; publishing evidence
is not a claim that all controls passed. Release assets do not have the CI
artifact expiry, but can be deleted by repository administrators: no immutable
regulatory retention or all-runs archive is claimed.

## Provenance attestation

`attest-binaries.yml` records a Sigstore-signed SLSA build provenance statement
for `payload.tar.gz`, then verifies it in the same job with `gh attestation
verify`, pinning the expected signer workflow and checking the verified subject
digest against the payload the job hashed itself. A signature nothing checks is
not a control, so a broken or unattached attestation fails the run.

It is a separate callable workflow rather than a job inside publication. GitHub
validates the scopes of every job in a called workflow at startup, including jobs
an `if:` would skip, so declaring `attestations: write` inside
`publish-binaries.yml` would force that grant on every caller and fail publication
with an opaque startup error for anyone who cannot grant it. Artifact attestations
are available because the repositories are public; a private repository would
need GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Confirm the caller's permissions before wiring the
workflow.

The default `on-unavailable: skip` tolerates only Enterprise Server identified
by a successful `GET /meta` response containing a nonempty `installed_version`.
Both gh calls derive a hostname from GitHub's HTTPS server URL; each step supplies
the job token through both `GH_TOKEN` and `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` so the CLI selects
the appropriate one for Cloud or Server.
No missing Cloud entitlement, HTTP status, OIDC error or signing failure is treated
as proof of unavailability. Both signing actions and provenance verification must
succeed; the outcome step runs even after failure and never reports it as success.
`on-unavailable: fail` also rejects proven unavailability. This runtime policy
cannot bypass permission validation before GitHub starts a job.

Migration from the earlier candidate: `skip` no longer suppresses arbitrary
signing errors. Repair permissions, entitlement or signing failures rather than
using that input as a general nonblocking mode. The CLI verifies the default
provenance predicate, not a second, independent SBOM predicate verification.

| Input | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact-id` | yes | Immutable release artifact ID produced by the CI workflow |
| `revision` | yes | Validated source commit; must equal the checked-out SHA |
| `on-unavailable` | no | `skip` by default, only for proven Enterprise Server unavailability; `fail` rejects it |

The caller grants `contents: read`, `id-token: write` and `attestations: write`
on that job alone. A consumer verifies a published artifact with
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo <org>/<repo>
--signer-workflow Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/.github/workflows/attest-binaries.yml`.
The consumer is the repository holding the attestation, not the reusable signer.

## Runnable dry-run examples

The [repository workflow](../.github/workflows/ci-internal.yml) is canonical:
relative references, all fifteen consumer/version cases, unique artifact keys,
and both binary/crate publisher dry-runs. No publishing secret is required.
External consumers pin the commit of a release; see [README](../README.md).

Local tests use controlled GitHub/Cargo stand-ins for live writes. The live
binary path runs on
[release-canary](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/release-canary): its
v0.1.0 tag went through preflight, CI, staging, two approved `release`
deployments, the upload, the attestation and the evidence, and SECURITY.md's
verification passed on the result. No crate upload to crates.io is claimed.
