//! `rust-gate quality`: formatting, Clippy with every warning denied, the
//! tests, the doc tests and strict rustdoc, after every workspace manifest
//! and source path is confirmed to lie inside the checkout. rustfmt and
//! Clippy take the organization's configuration from the gate at run time,
//! not from a file copied into the repository.
//!
//! The tests run under nextest, which gives each one its own process. Two
//! tests that share a global, a current directory or a temporary path pass
//! under one process and fail under another, and the version that catches them
//! is the one worth having. It also writes `JUnit`, which `cargo test` does not,
//! so report consumers can read results rather than scrape logs. Doc tests stay
//! on `cargo test --doc`: nextest does not run them, and dropping them silently
//! would trade a runner for a gap.
