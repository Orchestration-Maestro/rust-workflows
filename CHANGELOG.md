## [4.0.0](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/compare/v3.0.1...v4.0.0) (2026-09-25)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* a repository deletes its own toolbelt files, and each developer runs `rust-gate setup` and adds the PATH line it prints.
* upload-sarif.yml and upload-coverage.yml are removed. Every caller of ci.yml, publish-binaries.yml or publish-crate.yml grants `security-events: write` and `id-token: write`, which GitHub checks at startup for the skipped upload jobs; a release workflow's publisher job adds those two lines. Each repository's ci.yml caller is deleted by rust-gate sync.

### Features

* set up the pinned tools from the gate, not from each repository ([#70](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/issues/70)) ([0f0be71](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/commit/0f0be71a491a1c5a6944b7b2061eaf2db8fbdb07))
